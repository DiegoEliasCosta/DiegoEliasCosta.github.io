Hi, I am Diego and welcome to my academic space!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), Canada, working at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering in the [DAS Lab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/) of Prof. [Emad Shihab](http://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/). Before that, I was doing my PhD at Heidelberg University, Germany in the [Parallel and Distributed Systems Group](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/home/) of [Prof. Andrzejak](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/team/aa/). 


I am interested in Software Engineering Research. In a few words, I want to reduce the burden on software developers by tackling aspects related to **software maintenance** and **software performance**. 
I like to leverage historical project data (e.g., GitHub) through Data Mining methods and apply Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis techniques to understand the problems developers face and provide insights/solutions to alleviate the issues. 
Some projects I work on:
- Selecting efficient data structures in Java programs
- Investigating bad practices in Java benchmarking
- The challenges of dependency management in software ecosystems
- Bots in Software Engineering 

For details about my research, please check my [publication list](/publications/).
